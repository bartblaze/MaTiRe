# MaTiRe

This repository contains the LAB material used in the workshop on Malware Analysis, Threat Intelligence and Reverse Engineering. I'm naming the repository *MaTiRe* mostly due to current lack of inspiration.

You will need access to the slides if you wish to follow along. Those can be found on SlideShare below:

If you are interested how this workshop came to be, check out the accompanying blog post:

## About the LAB material

Some of the LABS have been created by me, but some contain actual malware. Always execute the LABS in a Virtual Machine (VM). I cannot be held reliable for any damages caused by the material in this repository.

The LABS I created myself, have been compiled on a VM as well, and can therefore contain certain clues, compression or obfuscation. Up to you to find what is relevant and in correspondence with the LAB exercises from the workshop!


### Help!

If you are having issues, questions or concerns with any of the LABS or accompanying material, just reach out.
